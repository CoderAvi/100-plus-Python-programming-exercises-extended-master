# Python-programming-exercises


***In this repository, I will be gradually updating the codebase of the given problems with my own solutions. Also, I may try to explain the code and tell my opinion about the problem if needed. Main Authors solutions are in python 2 & my solutions will be in python 3. Every problem is divided into a template format which is discussed below. There is a [discussion] section so don't forget to share your opinion, ideas and feel free to discuss anything wrong or mistake***
